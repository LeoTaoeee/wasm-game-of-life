This is an implementation on Conway's game of life in Rust, JS, and Webassembly. I made extensive use of (<a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack">wasm-pack</a>) and the related book. It should be noted that the program depends on version 16.0 of node.js, which is quite outdated and is exposed to security risks.
